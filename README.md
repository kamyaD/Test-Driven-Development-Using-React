At the core of being able to write clean code that you can depend on is a thorough knowledge of unit testing. In this project  I demonstrate my skills on  how to use the TDD cycle to create real-world user interfaces with the popular JavaScript library that was created by Facebook, React. First, I discover how to use TDD to write JavaScript functions. Next, I explore the syntax and ideas behind React. Finally, I demonstrate  how to combine React and TDD by using the Jest testing framework. 

This project demonstrates that I have  knowledge of both Test-driven Development and React.
